                <p>By checking this box, the Sponsor confirms and agrees to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>• The Sponsor has read and understood the Conference Sponsorship Terms and Conditions and agrees
                        to abide by all provisions set forth by the conference organizers.</li>
                    <li>• Sponsorship becomes binding upon confirmation from the organizers and payment of the
                        applicable sponsorship fee, which must be received within the period specified in the invoice.
                    </li>
                    <li>• The Sponsor grants the organizers the right to use provided logos, trademarks, company name,
                        and promotional materials in conference communications as outlined in the sponsorship agreement.
                    </li>
                    <li>• All sponsorship benefits, promotional opportunities, and conditions are as detailed in the
                        Sponsorship Prospectus and/or agreement, subject to organizer approval and adjustment.</li>
                    <li>• The Sponsor agrees not to assign, sublet, or transfer any portion of the sponsorship benefit
                        or package, except with prior written consent of the conference organizer.</li>
                    <li>• The organizers reserve the right to refuse or terminate sponsorship at their discretion if the
                        Sponsor is deemed inappropriate or is in breach of these terms.</li>
                    <li>• Payments made are non-refundable except in the case of event cancellation by the organizer, in
                        which case any refund will be subject to deduction of incurred costs.</li>
                    <li>• The Sponsor commits to compliance with all relevant laws, event policies, and intellectual
                        property obligations.</li>


                </ul>

                <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
                <p>These Event Sponsorship Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) govern Sponsor’s sponsorship of the
                    Event. The Sponsorship Order Form and these Terms form the “Agreement” between ICSTAIS2026 and
                    Sponsor regarding the Conference. Capitalized but undefined terms below have the meanings given to
                    them in Section 13.</p>
                <h3>1. Event Sponsorship</h3>
                <p>You may sponsor the Event by completing a Sponsorship Order Form and paying the applicable
                    Sponsorship Fees.</p>


                <h3>2. Fees.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>a. Payment Terms:</span> Sponsor must pay the Sponsorship Fees in accordance with the
                        payment terms set forth in the Sponsorship Order Form. If Sponsor does not pay the Sponsorship
                        Fees in accordance with such payment terms, then Sponsor may, at ICSTAIS2026’s sole discretion,
                        forfeit some or all of the benefits under the Sponsorship Order Form. All Sponsorship Fees are
                        guaranteed and non-refundable. However, if ICSTAIS2026 cancels the Event, ICSTAIS2026 may
                        provide Sponsor with a pro-rata refund after covering the costs ICSTAIS2026 had incurred to date
                        to host the Event.</li>
                    <li><span>b. Taxes:</span> All Sponsorship Fees payable by Sponsor are exclusive of applicable taxes
                        and duties, including, without limitation, GST and excise and sales taxes. All payments made by
                        Sponsor to ICSTAIS2026 must be made free and clear of any withholding or deduction for taxes. If
                        any such taxes are required to be withheld on any payment, Sponsor will pay such additional
                        amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by ICSTAIS2026 is equal to the amount
                        then due and payable under the Sponsorship Order Form.</li>
                    <li><span>c. Travel and Lodging:</span> ICSTAIS2026 is not responsible for any of Sponsor’s costs
                        for travel, lodging, or transportation to the Event. ICSTAIS2026 may make available negotiated
                        room rates with a lodging provider near the Event location to Sponsor (“Preferred Lodging
                        Rates”). However, travel, lodging, and transportation are Sponsor’s sole responsibility, and
                        Sponsor must book lodging prior to the deadline communicated to it by ICSTAIS2026 to attempt to
                        receive the Preferred Lodging Rates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ICSTAIS2026 will not be
                        liable for any failure of the lodging provider to make the Preferred Lodging Rates available to
                        Sponsor.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Sponsor Obligations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>a. Conduct: </span>Sponsor shall make no representations, express or implied, that it is
                        authorized or endorsed by ICSTAIS2026. Sponsor will cause all its Participants to: (A) be
                        considerate and respectful of others; and (B) refrain from: (1) demeaning, discriminatory or
                        harassing behavior or speech; and (2) harassment or discrimination based on age, ancestry, race,
                        gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, religion, sexual
                        orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable local laws, regulations, and
                        ordinances. Sponsor acknowledges that if one or more of its Participants engage in a violation
                        of the foregoing, or if a Participant is otherwise offensive, causing disruption, or causes
                        ICSTAIS2026 to fear for the safety of other attendees, then ICSTAIS2026 or its agents or service
                        providers may take any action ICSTAIS2026 or they deem appropriate, up to and including
                        expulsion from the Event without warning or refund. ICSTAIS2026 reserves the right to take any
                        safety and security measures that it deems necessary to ensure the safety of attendees, other
                        Exhibitors, and Participants without prior notice. Participants are expected to respect the
                        security and safety measures and protocols that have been put in place for the Event and to
                        follow any of ICSTAIS2026’s other rules or directions, and ICSTAIS2026 reserves the right to
                        refuse admission to, or to eject, any person not following such rules or directions.
                        Participants should not leave property unattended. Unattended property may be removed from the
                        Event venue, and ICSTAIS2026 will not be responsible for any loss or damage of any kind relating
                        to such removal.</li>
                    <li><span>b. Exhibits:</span> This Section applies only if Sponsor is permitted to have one or more
                        exhibits at the Event. In such instance, Sponsor shall comply with the hours and dates and other
                        instructions reasonably specified by ICSTAIS2026 for installing, occupying, and dismantling any
                        of Sponsor’s exhibits. These obligations include, without limitation, that: all exhibits and
                        displays must be in good taste, safe, in good condition and safely and entirely fit within the
                        10’x10’ space provided for Sponsor’s exhibit. Sponsor and its display(s) may not create
                        audio/noise that is excessively loud. The exhibit and any display may not exceed the 10’x10’
                        footprint and may not take up the entire 10’x10’ space. All power cords or wiring must hang
                        behind the display and all electrical connections and wiring must conform to the local fire code
                        for the event venue. Sponsor may use a custom table skirt as long as it is in good condition,
                        entirely covers the tabletop and drapes to the floor in front and on the sides. Electricity and
                        Wi-Fi is provided. Any special audiovisual needs must be ordered in advance through the venue’s
                        AV provider at additional expense to Sponsor. A representative of Sponsor must be present at the
                        Exhibit at all times during the hours the Event is open as outlined in the agenda and exhibitor
                        manual provided by ICSTAIS2026.</li>
                    <li>c. ICSTAIS2026 is entitled to remove all or a portion of Sponsor’s exhibits if ICSTAIS2026
                        objects to, without limitation, the content of such exhibits or if ICSTAIS2026 determines, in
                        its sole discretion, that Sponsor or its exhibit or display violate this Agreement. However,
                        ICSTAIS2026 may at its option first notify Sponsor and allow Sponsor to correct any
                        non-compliance. In the event of a removal of all or a portion of Sponsor’s exhibits, ICSTAIS2026
                        will not be liable for any damages or for refunding any costs incurred by Sponsor including,
                        without limitation, rental fees. ICSTAIS2026 reserves the right to adopt any additional rules,
                        move an exhibit, or take any further action as, in its reasonable opinion, is necessary for the
                        benefit of the Event.</li>
                    <li><span>d. Risk of Loss: </span>Sponsor acknowledges it assumes and bears the risk of shipping,
                        bringing, installing, occupying, and dismantling any Sponsor Property and Sponsor is responsible
                        for all shipping and handling costs for such Sponsor Property. Sponsor bears all responsibility
                        for ensuring any Sponsor Property and against any damage that Sponsor Property may cause or any
                        claims that may be related to such Sponsor Property. ICSTAIS2026 is not liable to Sponsor for
                        damage to or loss of any Sponsor Property whether in transit or at the Event.</li>
                    <li><span>e. Compliance with Law:</span> Sponsor will, and will cause its Participants to, comply
                        with all applicable laws when performing its obligations or exercising its rights under the
                        Agreement, including without limitation all applicable data protection laws that may apply to
                        Attendee Information.</li>
                    <li><span>f. Personal Information:</span> ICSTAIS2026 may, if included in the benefits for Sponsor
                        under the Sponsorship Order Form, provide Sponsor with personal information of Attendees
                        provided to ICSTAIS2026 during the Attendee’s registration for the Event, based on the
                        Attendee’s preferences for sharing of such personal information. Additionally, Sponsor may,
                        during the Event, scan Attendees’ badges to collect personal information of such Attendees.
                        Sponsor will make a privacy policy detailing its practices around collection, use, and
                        disclosure of personal information available to any Attendee, which may be available online.
                        Sponsor’s privacy policy must comply with applicable law. Sponsor shall only use personal
                        information in accordance with its privacy policy and applicable law.</li>
                    <li><span>g. Outside Activities:</span> Sponsor may not host, and must prohibit its Participants
                        from hosting, any activities and events, on or off property, that conflict with the published
                        event agenda. For clarification, no outside events will be permitted from the time the first
                        session or activity begins and the last session or activity ends on each day of the Event. If
                        Sponsor wishes to request an exception to this policy, Sponsor must notify ICSTAIS2026 in
                        advance of the planned activity and ICSTAIS2026 must approve such activity in writing.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4.	Privacy:</h3>
                <p>ICSTAIS2026 will process Sponsor’s information in accordance with ICSTAIS2026’s Privacy Policy</p>

                <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>a. Sponsor License:</span> Sponsor hereby grants to ICSTAIS2026 and its agents or service
                        providers a royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except to its service providers for use in
                        connection with the Event), non-transferable, and non-exclusive license to reproduce,
                        distribute, display, perform, and otherwise use:
                        <ul>
                            <li>(A) the Sponsor Marks provided to ICSTAIS2026 for display in connection with the Event
                                to identify Sponsor as a sponsor of the Event, both before and after the Event and to
                                indicate that Sponsor was a sponsor of the Event when marketing future events; and</li>
                            <li>(B) the Sponsor Materials to provide Sponsor the benefits under the Sponsorship Order
                                Form.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Sponsor must provide ICSTAIS2026 with the Sponsor Marks and the Sponsor Materials within 30 days
                        of executing the Sponsorship Order Form or at least 14 days prior to the Event, whichever is
                        sooner. If there is any delay in providing the Sponsor Marks or Sponsor Materials, ICSTAIS2026
                        may attempt to still provide the Deliverables specified in the Sponsorship Order Form at its
                        discretion but will not be required to do so.
                    </li>

                    <li><span>b. ICSTAIS2026 License:</span> If ICSTAIS2026 provides Sponsor with any Event Materials,
                        then, subject to the last sentence of this Section 5(b), ICSTAIS2026 hereby grants to Sponsor
                        (as defined below) a royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive
                        license to reproduce, use, display, perform, and distribute such Event Materials provided that
                        Sponsor complies with any guidelines ICSTAIS2026 provides for use of the Event Materials and
                        does not use the Event Materials, or any trademark, service mark, trade dress or logo displayed
                        in the Event Materials, in a manner that is disparaging to any other Person, sponsor or to
                        ICSTAIS2026 or its products or services.

                        If ICSTAIS2026 provides Sponsor with any ICSTAIS2026 Marks, then, subject to the last sentence
                        of this Section 5(b), ICSTAIS2026 hereby grants to Sponsor a revocable, royalty-free,

                        for any such proposed use. All use of the Event Materials or ICSTAIS2026 Marks must be
                        attributed to ICSTAIS2026 and the Event.

                        specific request for approval of any such filming, recording, or photography activities.
                    </li>

<h3>11. Disputes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>a. Binding Arbitration:</strong> Any dispute, claim, or action (each, a “Dispute”) relating in any way to the Event or the Agreement must be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that Sponsor may to the maximum extent permitted by law assert claims in small claims court.</li>

  <li><strong>b. Venue; Rules; Laws:</strong> Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by ICSTAIS2026 and Sponsor, any arbitration must take place in Denver, Colorado, and must be administered by, and pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of, the American Arbitration Association, including any expedited procedures. The arbitrator must apply the laws of the State of Colorado, exclusive of its conflict-of-law principles.</li>

  <li><strong>c. Scope:</strong> Any award of damages in arbitration is subject to the limitations of liability set forth in Section 9 of these Terms. There will be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or others similarly situated. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve any dispute and to make awards is limited to a dispute between ICSTAIS2026 and Sponsor alone. Any dispute brought by either party against the other party may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with a dispute brought by or against any third party, unless agreed to in writing by Sponsor and ICSTAIS2026. No arbitration award or decision on any disputes will be given preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.</li>

  <li><strong>d. Severability; Venue:</strong> If one or more parts of this Section 11 are found to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed, and the dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of Section 11 and all other provisions of the Agreement. If such severance results in all or some parts of a dispute proceeding in a court of law, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any such court proceeding will be the state or federal courts sitting in the City and County of Denver, Colorado. For purposes of any such court proceeding, Sponsor consents to, and will not challenge, such courts’ personal jurisdiction over Sponsor, and Sponsor further waives objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction. The laws of the State of Colorado (exclusive of its conflict-of-law principles) will govern such court proceeding.</li>

  <li><strong>e. Enforcement; Review:</strong> The provisions of this Section 11 and all arbitration awards duly made in connection therewith may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction, and the party seeking enforcement will be entitled to an award of all costs, fees, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in obtaining the enforcement of this provision, to be paid by the party against whom enforcement is ordered, provided that enforcement is ordered. All arbitration awards duly made hereunder will not be subject to review or appeal except as permitted by applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<h3>12. Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>a. Waiver:</strong> The failure by ICSTAIS2026 to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit its right to enforce such provision at a later time. All waivers by ICSTAIS2026 must be in writing to be effective.</li>

  <li><strong>b. Severability:</strong> If any portion of the Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining portions of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to affect the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from the Agreement but the rest will remain in full force and effect.</li>

  <li><strong>c. Force Majeure:</strong> ICSTAIS2026 will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond ICSTAIS2026’s reasonable control, including without limitation acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities, internet, or other telecommunication failures, earthquakes, storms, or other elements of nature, pandemics, epidemics, or shelter-in-place or similar orders, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, war, or changes in law.</li>

  <li><strong>d. Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; Independent Contractors; Construction:</strong> Sponsor may not assign or transfer the Agreement or any of Sponsor’s rights and obligations under the Agreement without ICSTAIS2026’s prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be void. ICSTAIS2026 may assign the Agreement to any third party without Sponsor’s consent. Subject to the foregoing, the Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party’s permitted successors and assigns. The Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to the Agreement. ICSTAIS2026 and Sponsor are independent contractors, and the Agreement will not be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship. In the Agreement, where the context so admits, words importing the singular number include the plural and vice versa.</li>

  <li><strong>e. Entire Agreement; Modifications:</strong> The Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all other agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding such subject matter. No amendment or modification to the Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.</li>
